# Knowledge Dashboard

## Summary
This dashboard is the entry point for the Obsidian vault. It highlights active projects, core learning areas, recent operational notes, and quick links that support a DevOps and AI knowledge workflow.

## Concepts
- A dashboard reduces navigation friction by linking high-value notes first.
- Stable top-level links make the vault easier for humans, RAG chunking, and MCP-driven agents to parse.
- Explicit note names improve search relevance and downstream embedding quality.

## Commands / Code
```bash
# Open the vault root and start from the dashboard
cd /Users/amitmishra/temp/ObsidianVault
```

## Architecture / Flow
1. Capture unstructured ideas in [[inbox-capture-staging]].
2. Promote durable work into [[02-Knowledge/index|Knowledge Index]] and project notes under `01-Projects/`.
3. Convert repeated commands into snippet notes under `03-Snippets/`.
4. Maintain operational history in [[ops-vault-bootstrap-log]].

## Use Cases
- Start daily work from a single navigation page.
- Surface the most important project and knowledge links for fast retrieval.
- Provide a clean anchor note for RAG indexing and agent orchestration.
